# SSP_beamforming

This is a repo for SSP mini-project: beamforming for throughput optimization in 5G.

Use two different ways to do beamforming: matched beamforming (assignment1) and flexibeam (assignment2).

## Project Structure
```
- ssp_assignment1.m   # code for matched beamforming by computing distance
- ssp_assignment1_inner_product.m   # code for matched beamforming by computing inner product
- ssp_assignment2.m   # code for flexibeam
- ssp_assignment2_inner_product.m   # code for flexibeam, consider (partial?) affects of radius and wave length
```

## TODO
1. influence of radius and wave length on flexibeam
2. convert from radiation pattern to throughput
